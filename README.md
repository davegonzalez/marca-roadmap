# Marca Roadmap

[See the roadmap](https://github.com/davegonzalez/marca-roadmap/projects/1)

This isn't the full backlog, but a public view into some of the major features I'm working on in building Marca* (official name TBD!). This repo contains no source code, but provides you visibility into what I'm working on and will eventually give you a way to suggest your own ideas for how to improve Marc.
